# Matthew's Modpacks

Welcome to a collection of my Technic modpacks! Right now there is only one, but I am working on fixing that soon. To download a modpack, head on over to the Releases section of this repo and select a pack. For the newest features, click bedrock version. For the best performance and compatibility, click the redstone version. To create a server, find the serverpack for your desired modpack. Download the zip file,  extract it, and run the Start.bat file.
