# HeliPack

Helipack is a modpack that adds the MCHeli, Archimedes Ships, and Ancient Warfare modpacks to Technic. This is great for city maps where helicopters are a good way to get around, and it can also be great for maps with lots of islands. Battling the helicopters and airplanes is fun too, but this pack needs a beefy server with a very far render distance, or else piloting the planes can be difficult.
